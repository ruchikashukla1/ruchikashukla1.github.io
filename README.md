# Ruchika Shukla Portfolio

A cosmic-themed portfolio website with a nebula swirling pinks, purples, blues, greens and yellows – no white tones in sight. Interactive white stars gently twinkle as you move the mouse and fade smoothly instead of vanishing. A dotted star orbit charts work and education, while projects appear as glowing planets. All text is white with a soft glow to stand out against the dark sky. The main headings feature a gentle gradient fill for a soft sheen.
