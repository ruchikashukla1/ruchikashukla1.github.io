# Ruchika Shukla Portfolio

A cosmic-themed portfolio website with a nebula swirling pinks, purples, blues, greens and yellows â€“ no white tones in sight. The background slowly shifts those colors so the nebula feels alive. Interactive white stars gently twinkle as you move the mouse and fade smoothly instead of vanishing. A dotted star orbit charts work and education, while projects appear as glowing planets. All text is white with a soft glow to stand out against the dark sky. The main headings feature a gentle gradient fill for a soft sheen. A friendly Quicksand font keeps the look soft and approachable.
