# Ruchika Shukla Portfolio

A cosmic-themed portfolio website featuring a colorful gradient backdrop that mixes shifting purples, pinks, greens and yellows â€“ no white tones in sight. Interactive white stars gently twinkle as you move the mouse and softly fade to a faint glow instead of disappearing. A dotted star orbit charts work and education, while projects appear as glowing planets. All text is white with a soft glow to stand out against the dark sky. The main headings feature a gentle gradient fill for a soft sheen. A friendly Quicksand font keeps the look soft and approachable.
